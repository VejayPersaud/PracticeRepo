Planning:
Seller shop where creators can sell products, visitors can browse and place orders and make accounts, a messaging notification system to communicate between sellers and site visitors. GraphQL should fetch data, Go will handle core logic, Postgres stores data, Redis caches and queues. Deployment on Google Cloud Platform through GKE or AWS.
